    "## Introduction to SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL** (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used to manage and manipulate data in relational databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "It allows users to create, read, update, and delete data (often abbreviated as CRUD) through statements that interact with tables of structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is also used to define and control the structure of databases, manage access permissions, and perform complex queries such as filtering, joining, grouping, and aggregating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, SQL provides the means to communicate with and organize data stored in relational database systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Why SQL? \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is popular because it is standardized and powerful for data manipulation. \n",
    "It allows you to retrieve exactly the information you need from potentially large datasets by writing concise queries. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, instead of writing complex code to filter and aggregate data, you can write a single SQL query to do it. SQL is also declarative ‚Äì you specify what data you want, not how to get it, and the database engine figures out the best way to compute the result. This makes it accessible: its commands use common words (SELECT, WHERE, etc.), making basic queries relatively easy to learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Another advantage is that SQL skills are transferable; almost all relational databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, etc.) support SQL with only minor differences in dialect.\n",

    "### Basic SQL example\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT <columns> \n",
    "FROM <table_name>\n",
    "WHERE <condition>\n",
    "ORDER BY <column>;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Breakdown:\n",
    "- **SELECT** specifies which columns of data you want to retrieve (or SELECT * for all columns).\n",
    "- **FROM** specifies the table where the data is stored.\n",
    "- **WHERE** is optional; it adds a filter condition to return only rows that meet certain criteria.\n",
    "- **ORDER** BY is optional; it sorts the result by the specified column(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a table movies with columns for title, year, genre, etc. If we want to find all comedy movies released after 2010, our SQL query might look like:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT title, year, genre \n",
    "FROM movies \n",
    "WHERE genre = 'Comedy' AND year > 2010 \n",
    "ORDER BY year;\n",

    "## What Are Relational Databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **relational database** is a type of database that stores data in **tables** ‚Äî organized structures made up of **rows** and **columns** ‚Äî and defines **relationships** between those tables using shared data values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîë Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tables**: Each table represents a specific type of entity (for example, `Students`, `Courses`, or `Enrollments`).  \n",
    "- **Rows (records)**: Each row corresponds to one instance of that entity ‚Äî e.g., one student or one course.  \n",
    "- **Columns (fields)**: Each column represents a property or attribute of the entity ‚Äî e.g., `name`, `id`, or `email`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîó Relationships Between Tables\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational databases are called *‚Äúrelational‚Äù* because tables are **linked (related)** through **keys**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A **primary key** uniquely identifies each record in a table.  \n",
    "- A **foreign key** establishes a link to a primary key in another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure allows data to remain **normalized** (avoiding duplication) while still being combined flexibly using **JOIN operations** when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üß© Example\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have the following tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Students**\n",
    "| student_id | name       | major        |\n",
    "|-------------|------------|--------------|\n",
    "| 1           | Alice Chen | Data Science |\n",
    "| 2           | Ben Patel  | Economics    |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Courses**\n",
    "| course_id | title               |\n",
    "|------------|--------------------|\n",
    "| 101        | Database Systems   |\n",
    "| 102        | Machine Learning   |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Enrollments**\n",
    "| student_id | course_id |\n",
    "|-------------|-----------|\n",
    "| 1           | 101       |\n",
    "| 1           | 102       |\n",
    "| 2           | 101       |\n",

    "1. Copies your DataFrames into an in-memory SQLite database.\n",

    "\n",
    "**SQLite** is a **lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine**.  \n",
    "Unlike most database systems (such as MySQL or PostgreSQL) that run as separate servers, **SQLite runs entirely inside your application** ‚Äî there‚Äôs no external process to manage.\n",
    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs often described as *‚Äúa database in a file‚Äù* because the entire database ‚Äî tables, indexes, and data ‚Äî is stored in a **single `.sqlite` or `.db` file** on disk.\n",

    "---\n",

    "### ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Serverless:** No setup or configuration needed. You can start using it immediately.\n",
    "- **Self-contained:** Everything (data, schema, logic) is stored in one portable file.\n",
    "- **Zero Configuration:** No installation or separate server process required.\n",
    "- **Transactional:** Supports ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform:** Works on all major operating systems with identical behavior.\n",
    "- **Embedded:** Used in many applications (e.g., browsers, mobile apps, operating systems).\n",

    "- **Small-scale projects** or prototypes\n",
    "- **Applications that need a local database**, like mobile or desktop apps\n",
    "- **Temporary or embedded data storage** during development\n",
